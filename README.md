# Hey folks! 👋

**papgmez** here. I was born in November 1996 and I'm from Spain.

I'm a passionate Ruby on Rails and Elixir/Phoenix developer with a deep love for writing clean, reliable and readable code that tells a story.  
I love design, computer science, software development, and Open Source philosophy. I enjoy researching new Ruby gems or contributing to open-source projects that catch my interest.  
I love face up new problems and always make sure about my plans or ideas going well.

I'm currently remote working at [Bizneo](https://www.bizneo.com), an all-in-one HR software.

When I'm not coding, I enjoy learning and keeping up to date in the world of AI, specifically in the world of LLMs and their agent capabilities.

## Beyond Code
I like to read books, watch movies and play video games.  
I also like to unplugging completely to enjoy the outdoors and nature, meeting with friends, working out or just walking around 🚶‍♂️.
